//in 2D matrix, sorted on each row, first element of next row is larger to the last element of previous row, now giving a target number,
//returning the position that the target locates within the matrix


//Solution:
//left = [0][0] = 0
//right = [m-1] [n-1] = 11
//mid = (right-left)/2 = 5
//mid-> row = 5 / # of column
//mid -> column = 5 % # of column

//time complex: log(m) + log(n) = log (m * n);
