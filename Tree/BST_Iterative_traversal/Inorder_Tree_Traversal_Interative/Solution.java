//1) Create an empty stack S.
//2) Initialize current node as root
//3) Push the current node to S and set current = current->left until current is NULL
//4) If current is NULL and stack is not empty then
//    a) Pop the top item from stack.
//    b) Print the popped item, set current = popped_item->right
//    c) Go to step 3.
//5) If current is NULL and stack is empty then we are done.
